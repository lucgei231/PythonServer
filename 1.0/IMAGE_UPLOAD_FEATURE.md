```

## API Documentation

### Upload Image Request
```
POST /upload_quiz_image/<quiz_name>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Form Data:
- image: <file>
```

### Upload Image Response (Success)
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "url": "/UploadedImages/quiz-name/20250129_153005_123456.png",
    "filename": "20250129_153005_123456.png"
}
```

### Upload Image Response (Error)
```json
{
    "error": "File type not allowed. Only .png, .webp, .jpg, .jpeg are supported"
}
```

## Security Features

1. **Filename Sanitization**: Uses `secure_filename()` to prevent directory traversal
2. **File Type Validation**: Extension check against whitelist
3. **File Size Validation**: Enforces 300MB limit before saving
4. **Quota Management**: Max 20 images per quiz prevents abuse
5. **Unique Filenames**: Timestamp-based naming prevents collisions
6. **IP Logging**: All uploads logged with client IP address

## How Users Use It

### In addquiz.html:
1. Upload quiz file (as before)
2. Below the quiz upload, use the image upload section
3. Click "Upload Images" to add photos
4. Images appear in preview grid below
5. Click × to remove unwanted images from preview
6. Proceed with quiz editing as normal

### In editquiz.html:
1. Open quiz for editing (as before)
2. At the top, see the "📸 Quiz Images" section
3. Add new images the same way as addquiz
4. Edit quiz content in modern or legacy editor
5. Save quiz (images are saved independently)

## Validation & Error Handling

| Scenario | Error Message |
|----------|---------------|
| No file selected | "Please select at least one image file" |
| Unsupported extension | "File type not allowed. Only .png, .webp, .jpg, .jpeg are supported" |
| File > 300MB | "File too large. Maximum size is 300MB" |
| Quiz has 20+ images | "Maximum 20 images per quiz reached" |
| Upload network error | "Error uploading [filename]: [error message]" |

## Technical Notes

- Images are stored separately from quiz data (quiz `.txt` files)
- Image URLs are returned immediately after upload
- Images persist in `/UploadedImages/` directory
- No database required - filesystem-based storage
- Each quiz has its own subdirectory for organization
- Filenames use ISO timestamp to prevent collisions

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Bulk delete images for a quiz
- Thumbnail regeneration for different sizes
- Image compression/optimization
- Integration with question builder to attach images to specific questions
- Drag-to-reorder images
- Image description/caption support
