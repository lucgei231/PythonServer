3. **Scroll down** and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. **Name it** "QuizFabric" (or your preferred name)
5. **Tap Add** - The app icon will appear on your home screen
6. **Tap the icon** to launch QuizFabric as a full-screen app

2. **Tap the menu** (three dots, top-right)

## Features Provided by PWA

✅ **Home Screen Installation** - Install as a native-looking app
✅ **Full Screen Experience** - No browser UI when installed
✅ **Custom App Icon** - Your QuizFabric icon on home screen
✅ **Offline Support** - Basic offline functionality via service worker
✅ **Status Bar Styling** - Custom iOS status bar appearance
✅ **Fast Load Times** - Assets cached for quick startup
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all device sizes

## Icon Requirements

The app currently uses `/data/icon.png` as the app icon. For best results:
- **Minimum size**: 192x192 pixels
- **Recommended size**: 512x512 pixels (for high-res displays)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Design**: Keep padding around the icon content for iOS

If you want to optimize the icon experience, you can add larger versions in `manifest.json`:
- 192x192 for standard devices
- 512x512 for high-res devices
- 256x256 as intermediate size

## Configuration Details

### Manifest.json Customization
If you want to customize the app further, edit `/static/manifest.json`:
- Change `name` or `short_name` for different branding
- Adjust `theme_color` to match your brand
- Modify `background_color` for splash screen
- Update `categories` for app store classification

### Service Worker Cache
The service worker caches:
- CSS stylesheets
- JavaScript files
- The app icon
- HTML pages (dynamically)

To update what's cached, edit `/static/service-worker.js` and modify the `urlsToCache` array.

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Safari (iOS) | ✅ Full Support |
| Chrome (Android) | ✅ Full Support |
| Firefox (Android) | ✅ Full Support |
| Safari (macOS) | ✅ Partial Support |
| Chrome (Desktop) | ✅ Full Support |
| Edge (Desktop) | ✅ Full Support |

## Troubleshooting

### App Not Appearing on iOS?
- Make sure you're using Safari (not Chrome)
- Enable JavaScript in Settings
- Check that the website is HTTPS or localhost
- Clear Safari cache and try again

### Icon Not Showing?
- Verify `/data/icon.png` exists and is accessible
- Try clearing app cache (Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data)
- Ensure icon is at least 192x192 pixels

### Service Worker Not Registering?
- Check browser console for errors (Developer Tools)
- Verify service-worker.js is in `/static/` directory
- Ensure HTTPS or localhost (service workers require secure context)

## Next Steps

1. **Test Installation**: Try installing the app on your device
2. **Customize Icon**: Replace `/data/icon.png` with a higher-res version if desired
3. **Set Splash Screen**: Add `screenshots` to manifest.json for better app preview
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check if offline caching is working as expected
